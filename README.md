## Affiliation

Just as the primary Lotus mod is not affiliated with Innersloth, neither is this one. However, do NOT join the official Lotus server for bug reports. Unfortunately, we do not have an existing Discord server yet.

## Miscellaneous

Currently, this version has no unique chat (or any other non-role) functions. View the <a href = "https://github.com/ImaMapleTree/Lotus">official Lotus page</a> to view any existing chat functions, name functions, or other.

## Roles

To preserve conciseness, please see the <a href = "https://github.com/ImaMapleTree/Lotus#roles">official Lotus role list</a> to view the details on the unmodified roles.

## Future Plans:
Everything we are either planning to add to the mod or that is already in the mod is documented on this google doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YrOCMbI-455rk5XPDLBt5HM4-9uvXjjPVm47fRRzjTI/edit

Please note: The google doc is updated frequently with new ideas for the mod.
Outside of that, there are plans to add full proper crediting to the github, google doc and in game with the /r command.
